This repository contains the material for a 3 day class on text adventures and python.

The `code/` folder contains code examples in python focused on different paradigms/abstraction levels.

Students are supposed to study the code and then use it as an inspiration and basis in order to develop their own mini-game.

The idea was inspired by the awesome book [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/) by Zed Shaw which I used to teach myself python over 10 years ago.
